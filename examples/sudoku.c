/* For Sudoku, there are 9x9x9=729 possible choices (9 numbers to choose for
   each cell in a 9x9 grid), and 4x9x9=324 constraints with each constraint
   representing a set of choices that are mutually conflictive with each other.
   The 324 constraints are classified into 4 categories:

   1. row-column where each cell contains only one number
   2. box-number where each number appears only once in one 3x3 box
   3. row-number where each number appears only once in one row
   4. col-number where each number appears only once in one column

   Each category consists of 81 constraints. We number these constraints from 0
   to 323. In this program, for example, constraint 0 requires that the (0,0)
   cell contains only one number; constraint 81 requires that number 1 appears
   only once in the upper-left 3x3 box; constraint 162 requires that number 1
   appears only once in row 1; constraint 243 requires that number 1 appears
   only once in column 1.

   Noting that a constraint is a subset of choices, we may represent a
   constraint with a binary vector of 729 elements. Thus we have a 729x324
   binary matrix M with M(r,c)=1 indicating the constraint c involves choice r.
   Solving a Sudoku is reduced to finding a subset of choices such that no
   choices are present in the same constaint. This is equivalent to finding the
   minimal subset of choices intersecting all constraints, a minimum hitting
   set problem or a eqivalence of the exact cover problem.

   The 729x324 binary matrix is a sparse matrix, with each row containing 4
   non-zero elements and each column 9 non-zero elements. In practical
   implementation, we store the coordinate of non-zero elements instead of
   the binary matrix itself. We use a binary row vector to indicate the
   constraints that have not been used and use a column vector to keep the
   number of times a choice has been forbidden. When we set a choice, we will
   use up 4 constraints and forbid other choices in the 4 constraints. When we
   make wrong choices, we will find an unused constraint with all choices
   forbidden, in which case, we have to backtrack to make new choices. Once we
   understand what the 729x324 matrix represents, the backtracking algorithm
   itself is easy.

   A major difference between the algorithm implemented here and Guenter
   Stertenbrink's suexco.c lies in how to count the number of the available
   choices for each constraint. Suexco.c computes the count with a loop, while
   the algorithm here keeps the count in an array. The latter is a little more
   complex to implement as we have to keep the counts synchronized all the time,
   but it is 50-100% faster, depending on the input.
