This is an announcement of an upcoming feature.

<!--more-->

C declaration syntax, when you get used to it, is relatively easy to use, but
in more complex situations, it can confuse even experienced programmers. One
of its problems is inconsistency: the basic schema of *declaration-specifiers*
stating the *base* type, followed by a comma-separated list of *declarators*,
with variable name wrapped in a mixture of type operators, is used for declaring
structure and union members as well as variables, but not for function parameters,
where each parameter is described completely separately from the previous one:

{% highlight C %}
// base type followed by list of declarators for int-derived types:
int i, *ip, **ipp, (*pfi)();

// have to repeat 'int' base type for each parameter:
extern void foo(int i, int *ip, int **ipp, int (*pfi)()); 
{% endhighlight %}

This inconsistency is not annoying, but complicates parsing; it also inhibits
some kinds of parsing for WCPL-specific syntactic constructs needed to support
multiple return values, so we have decided to relax the function parameter syntax 
to bring it in-line with variable declarations syntax, and vice versa.

The relaxed syntax uses the same approach for both lists of declarations. The
relaxed form of declaration list starts with *declaration-specifiers* stating 
the base type, followed by a comma-separated list of declarators (as in
C syntax for variables and members), *but*, after each comma, a new base 
type may be introduced, serving one or more subsequent declarations having 
just *declarators* and no base type of their own:

{% highlight C %}
// WCPL: base type can be switched mid-list:
int i, *ip, double d, **dpp, (*pff)(), char c, *cp;

// WCPL: no need to repeat shared base type for sibling parameters:
extern void foo(int i, *ip, double d, **dpp, (*pff)(), char c, *cp); 
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, the relaxed format is backward-compatible with C, but does
not enforce C-specific dichotomy between variable/member declarations and 
parameter lists. Naturally, any new feature can be abused; the fact that
in typedefs and forward declarations of functions parameter names are
optional, allows for these cryptic forms:

{% highlight C %}
// WCPL: minimalistic declaration with anonymous parameters:
extern void foo(int, *, **, (*)()); 

// same declaration in its traditional form:
extern void foo(int i, int *ip, int **ipp, int (*pfi)()); 
{% endhighlight %}

Taken to the extreme, this may lead to something even more cryptic:

{% highlight C %}
// WCPL: truly bizarre declaration with anonymous parameters:
extern void foo(int,,,); 

// same declaration in its traditional form:
extern void foo(int, int, int, int); 
{% endhighlight %}

All curiosities aside, relaxing declarations in this way will allow
us to parse the upcoming syntax for multiple return values while still
using single-token lookahead. More on this later...
