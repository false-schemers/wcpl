WCPL fully supports `<stdarg.h>` header defining a type and three macros for
advancing through an array of values supplied as the value of the `...` (ellipsis) 
argument. Internally, this argument comes last in the argument list and has the 
`va_list` type, defined internally as follows: 

{% highlight C %}
typedef union va_arg { 
  int va_int; 
  unsigned int va_uint;
  long va_long; 
  unsigned long va_ulong;
  long long va_llong; 
  unsigned long long va_ullong;
  size_t va_size; 
  double va_double;
  v128_t va_v128;
  void *va_voidptr;
} va_arg_t, *va_list;
{% endhighlight %}

WCPL has no requirement of the ellipsis argument to be preceded by 'normal' arguments; if needed,
`...` can be the only argument in the argument list. The ellipsis argument can be referenced
in the body of the function as a pointer expression either via WCPL-specific intrinsic `va_etc()`
or via its equivalent pseudo-variable `...`. The following is a legal WCPL code (which, 
of course, can return garbage if no arguments are supplied to `foo` by the caller):

{% highlight C %}
int foo(...) /* WCPL */
{ 
  return ...[0].va_int; 
}
{% endhighlight %}

It is compiled to the following WASM code:

```
(func $_:foo (export "foo")
  (param $ap$ i32) (result i32)
  local.get $ap$
  i32.load offset=0 align=4
  return
)
```

The `va_arg` form is an intrinsic (cannot be a macro because WCPL macros can't
have types as parameters):

`va_arg(ap, type)` is equivalent to `*(type*)ap++`

The rest of the standard macros for variable argument access are defined as follows:

{% highlight C %}
#define va_start(ap, v) ((ap) = ...)
#define va_end(ap) ((void)(ap = NULL))
#define va_copy(dst, src) ((dst) = (src))
{% endhighlight %}


Also, WCPL supports a `countof` intrinsic, which serves three purposes. It can act as
a shortcut for counting the number of elements in an array, so if `a` is an array
expression:

`countof(a)` is equivalent to `sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0])` 

Its second purpose is to access the number of the arguments supplied to vararg function:
`countof(...)` returns the corresponding count, which is always stored by the caller in 
`va_arg_t`-typed slot preceding the first actual argument in the `...` argument array:

`countof(...)` is equivalent to `...[-1].va_size`

This feature makes it possible to write code like this:

{% highlight C %}
int sumints(...) /* WCPL */
{ 
  size_t n = countof(...); 
  int sum = 0;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    sum += ...[i].va_int;
  }
  return sum; 
}
{% endhighlight %}

WCPL's `<stdarg.h>` header defines an additional macro for this scenario:

{% highlight C %}
#define va_count() (countof(...)) /* WCPL */
{% endhighlight %}

The third purpose of `countof()` is related to variadic and generic macros; it will
be described in the next few posts.
