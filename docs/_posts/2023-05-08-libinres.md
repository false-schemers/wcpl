Starting with version `1.04`, all bundled libraries (see `lib` folder) are embedded *inside the executable*, 
so using them needs no `-L`/`-I` options. All embedded library files are logged as belonging to `res://` 
pseudo-directory (a compressed archive inside `l.c`); `res://lib/` is always used as a fallback search
location, so explicit locations given via `-L` have priority and can override built-in versions if
needed.

The embedded archive is generated with the help of `baz` archiver (see https://github.com/false-schemers/baz);
the command is: 

```
baz cvfz l.c --exclude="src" --exclude="lib/include/NDEBUG" --exclude="README.md" --zopfli=1000 wcpl/lib
``` 
It uses external `zopfli`* compressor to get excellent compression rates for `.wo` files, so the whole
built-in archive adds only about 90K to size of the executable.
