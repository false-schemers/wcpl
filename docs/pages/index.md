WCPL (Webassembly Combined Programming Language) is a standalone self-hosted compiler/linker/libc 
for a subset of C targeting Webassembly and WASI. It supports most traditional pre-C99 C features 
except for full C preprocessor and K&R-style function parameter declarations (modern prototypes 
are fully supported). Features listed below are the ones that are either borrowed from modern 
C dialects, or not implemented in the way described in C90 standard.
